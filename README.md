# Python for Data Visualization

This repository contains my exercise files and projects from the LinkedIn Learning course **"Python for Data Visualization"** by Madecraft, instructed by Michael Galarnyk.

## Course Description

Data visualization is a critical skill for data scientists, enabling them to communicate insights effectively to non-technical audiences. This course provides a practical guide to creating professional, accurate, and engaging charts and graphs using Python, without needing to be a design expert.

Key topics covered include:
*   Utilizing powerful Python libraries like **pandas** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib** for visualization.
*   Techniques for loading and cleaning datasets to prepare them for visualization.
*   Creating a variety of simple and advanced plots, including:
    *   Line plots
    *   Scatter plots
    *   Bar charts
    *   Histograms
    *   Heatmaps
    *   Subplots

## About the Course

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, you can install the core libraries manually: `pip install pandas matplotlib jupyter`)*

4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal log of my learning progress and a practical reference for data visualization techniques in Python. The code and comments reflect my work and understanding of the course material.
